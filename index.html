		<h2>Our history</h2>   
	    	<p>Created in 2018 by its young founder Benoit Raillard-Cazanove, a graduate of HEC Paris, and his associates, La Chaussetterie was born above all from a shared passion for socks, whether handmade or industrial. The adventure started quietly in the small town of Aix-en-Provence before the Chaussetterie, strengthened by its success, set up in several large cities such as Marseille, Paris and Lyon.</p>
